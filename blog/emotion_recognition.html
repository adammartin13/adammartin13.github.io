                            It's late Spring in a college apartment dimly lit by a TV. I’m exchanging the evening homework study for a 
                            crack at inspiration, watching Ex Machina. I was a film snob and a sophomore coder coming off the back of a 
                            failed project. I needed ideas, but tonight was just another movie. Enjoying cinema that wasn’t another cape 
                            flick. Momentarily satisfied by movies, but still hungry for the next thing.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Our protagonist Caleb enters the glass interview chamber for his third interview with Ava. His mannerisms and 
                            body language indicate a strange disbelief at the android on the other side of the glass and his feelings towards 
                            her. Ava makes an attempt to reach him. <i>Are you attracted to me?</i> Caleb doesn’t know how to respond. <i>You give me 
                            indications that you care. Microexpressions. The way your eyes fix on my eyes and lips. The way you hold my gaze.</i>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In the LCD blue light I opened myself to late night thoughts on AI. Would it exhibit full automata? Does an AGI have rights?
                            If it can not feel in the same way that we do, through biochemical hormonal processes, then could it at least attempt to 
                            understand emotions? If it could, then would it change its output in the same way that our conversations evolve with the 
                            mood and atmosphere surrounding the discussions framework? I believed in this central theory that an AGI being able to 
                            represent the full spectrum of human emotion, thought, and creativity was not off the table.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I found Caleb’s attachment to Ava suspect. Why would someone share these feelings with an android? Even if Ava exhibited full 
                            autonomy so as to say that she is merely an artificial human, why would he fall for someone that he’s only met a handful of 
                            times and knows so little of? Given that it is later revealed that Nathan, Ava’s creator, designed Ava around Caleb’s porn 
                            history and chose Caleb for his moral compass and perhaps his relationship situation, is it not out of the question that Nathan 
                            perhaps exploited Caleb’s emotions for his experiment? That Ava was in fact, able to understand Caleb’s emotions at such a high 
                            level that it could be weaponized to her advantage.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It stuck to me. I enjoyed the dystopian thriller, the emotional manipulation of our characters, the artistic expression in color 
                            identity and theological representations. But that word, <i>microexpressions</i>, lingered like morbid curiosity. She was able to 
                            manipulate him because she had an understanding of his emotions, but how did she understand his emotions? Was it purely from 
                            microexpressions or are there other ways in which we express how we feel? In the present sense, what tools do LLM’s use today to 
                            utilize our emotions or do such tools even exist? In the quiet dark of that late night college apartment, I then found my new 
                            project.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I went straight to the drawing board. Like any project I’ve pursued I was young and nose diving into unfamiliar territory. I knew 
                            large language models were essentially vectorizing text as part of some training measure, but whether or not emotion could be 
                            represented as an additional input vector was unknown to me. What I could infer however is that before I could ever enhance a 
                            large language model through this capacity, I would first need the tools necessary to understand human emotion.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This was my first software project that I felt transcended the realm of simply coding a solution to a problem and dipped into 
                            learning new subject matters I’ve never studied before. Combining coding with psychology and anatomy. It presented this vastly 
                            entertaining quest where I allowed myself to learn more about my skills while also discovering people in a manner I’ve never 
                            thought about previously.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I read several papers, some of which indicated that the spectrum of emotions could be determined via 
                            <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7037130/">brain waves, skin conductivity, and heart rate.</a>
                            In particular I was interested in 
                            <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2342913/#!po=15.7407">facial expression associations and their relative muscle activations.</a>

                        <p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p>
